Operators
 -terms
  -Unary
    -single operator, such as -x is being applied to whatever takes the variables place
  -binary
    -operator is binary if it has two operrands
  -Operand 
    -What operators are applied to, numbers/variables
 -numeric conversion, unary
  -Use the + sign to convert things to numbers
   -to use on strings you must use a +deirectly before the string
 -Operators precedence
  -Table below, we'll take notes as I view it
  …	…	                   …
16	unary plus	           +
16	unary negation         -
14	multiplication	       *
14	division	           /
13	addition	           +
13	subtraction	           -
…	…	…
3	assignment	            =

  -bigger numbers execute first 
  -if they are the same they execute left to right
 -assignment operators save the value

 -remainder 
  - % gives us the amount left over after division of two numbers
  - (5 % 2 returns 1) 8 % 3 returns 2 (6 % 3 returns 0)

 - exponation multiplys a number by itself using **
  - 2 ** 2 (2 * 2) 
  - 2 ** 3 (2 * 2 * 2)
 -incriment / decrement
  -- is the same as (- 1) ++ is the same as (+ 1)
  -they only work on variables, not numbers
 -bitwise operators
  -and &
  -or |
  -xor ^
  -not ~
  - left shift <<
  - right shift >>
  - zero-fill right shift >>>
 -modift in place
  -assigning shorthand
  - w=2; w += 3; w would retrun 5
 -comma (the oddball)
  -we use this to shorten code
  - only the last code/string will appear

tasks
 - a = 2
   b = 2
   c = 2
   D = 1

 - a = 4
   x = 5
