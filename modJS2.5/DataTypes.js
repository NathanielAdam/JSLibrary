/*
variables can be strings/numbers/boleans(true/false)

erroneous division returns nan
dividing by zero gives infinity

strings
  -quoted things, not treated like numbers think spoken words
  - single '' double "" and backticks `` are all valid and will make strings
  - backticks can be used to imbed variables/ mathmatic operations; into strings

boleans 
  -two types true/false 
  -they are the results of comparisons or declarations

null
  -it's own value type
  -used more for a placeholder (could change as I learn more)

undefined
  -Exactly what it sounds like;
  -descripes variables/solutions that aren't defined in the bounds of JS

typeOf
  -returns the type of variable that you feed it is
  -when feeding it predetermined things such as math and null, it will return object, and function if given a function like alert or a custom function
